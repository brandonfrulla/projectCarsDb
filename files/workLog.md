Sep 19 2020 - Worked from 13:45 - 14:45
    > Established the basic skeleton of I/O processes necessecary for project 
    completion.
Sep 22 2020 - Worked from 16:00 - 18:00
    > Established menu functionality for the user menu
    > Looked into creating the "multiple files" and how the .c and .h discrepancy 
    will work out in my design.
Sep 23 2020 - Worked from 13:30 - 15:00
    > Implemented loop  that created car objects from file lines, with write 
    functionality included to the out file.
    > Implemented loop to the menu/user choice aspects of the code to better 
    handle multiple actions taken by a user in any given use session.
Oct 2 2020 - Worked from 11:00 - 13:00, 15:30 - 17:30
    > Split my function that did read/write in one function to two functions to be called 
    at separate times. 
    > Built print functionality of the UI
    > Implemented FileNotFoundException "Try/catch"
Oct 4 2020 - Worked from 11:30 - 18:00
    > Added car.c
    > Implemented menu for respective user types
    > Built out 8 methods from car.h file
Oct 5 2020 - Worked from 12:30 - 18:00 
    > Worked out compilation bugs and segmentation faults
    > This day was a massive time drain, absolutely brutal drudgery
Oct 6 2020 - Worked from 15:00 - 21:00
    > Cleared up the last of the segmentation faults/errors
    > Implemented final methods for owner/ worked through compilation issues 
oct 7 2020 - 9:00 - 12:30
    > Added method calls to menu spots in switch statements
    > finished getCar & addcar methods
Oct 9 2020 - 13:00 - 17:00, 18:30 - 20:30
    > implemented find car into multiple other methods, as well as print car to improve performance 
    and remove redundant code 
    > implemented delete car function for in a way for purchase car function to also be able to use it
    > implemented getYears and some other stuff
    > had to stop to maintain sanity
Oct 10 2020 - 14:30 - 21:00
    > refactored a lot of the code for improved reusability
    > added the edge case print statements
    > made sure everything worked as it should
Oct 11 2020 - 0620 - 11:30
    > Made sure implementation matched with specifications of the project
    > developed Makefile
    > cleaned up code in general, edge tests
Oct 17 2020 16:00 - 17:30
    > implemented eneumerated type and fixed subsequent bugs in car.c
Oct 18 2020 9:30 - 
    > continued fixing bugs caused by Categories becoming an enumerated type
    > tested code against gusty test files and fixed as needed
